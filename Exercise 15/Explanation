Hubs.java has three preditermined hubs, and the same number of authorities. There must be six
or more sites inputed for the code to work. When run, in conjunction with Transition.java
and Markov.java:
java Hubs 10 1000 | java Transition | java Markov 40
the result was:
0.12842 0.14386 0.14021 0.07974 0.07844 0.08568 0.07926 0.08745 0.08264 0.09434
The hubs were the first three sites, 0, 1, 2. The authorities were the sites 3, 4, 5.
The Hubs had significantlly higher ranks due to the links that pulled trafic towards them, 
as opposed to the authorities, whose links had no impact on their rank. While these results
will not allways be true, as their is some randomness, a large enough sample size suggests,
that the Hubs should allways be ranked higher.
