Using markov chains it was found that the rankings for the senario in ex16.txt was 
0.17522 0.09315 0.05622 0.03961 0.03213 0.35760 0.24726
If you were to look at the file, you could see that site 5 only has 3 links to it, yet 
site 6 has 4, however site 5 has a higher ranking. This is beacuse sites 2 3 and 4 could 
be replaced by one site, as they either go to site 6, or one site further. At 4 the web 
has to go to site six. This chain allows for 3 superfluos links, and when combined with
the meaningful links going to site 3, allows site 3 to have a higher rating.
