When links where created from site 23 to any other site, the resulting ranking of the site 
was higher. This is beacuse the structure of the links in medium.txt, did not allow for a 
situation in which a link led to the internet surfer being steared away from the terminal 
site. This makes sense, as by adding a link to a site, there is only a greater number of 
links to that site, and with the known stabilizing patern used by Markov.java it can be seen
that increased links lead to a higher rating.
