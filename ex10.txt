To solve question ten, our group decided to add links from sites to 23, until one of the 
sites saw a lesser rating. Ths happened when a link between site 2 and 23 was established 
as accroding to Markov.java, the rating droped from 0.00909 to 0.00893. This is an example 
of a link form one site to another hurting the site that gave the link to site 23.
