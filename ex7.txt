By adding links from 23 to every other site, certain internet behavioral paterns were 
favored over others. Markov.java was used to reasses the rankings, and the resulting 
two lists were compared by nature of having each corresponding value diveded by the 
original value, thereby finding the change that occured at that individual site. As a whole
the average value of change was 19%, the site that saw the greatest inreace in traffic was 
site #21, which saw an change of 49%, and the site least affected was 46, which saw a 1% 
change in trafic. Oddly enough site #23 lost 8% of its trafic, and the other great losers 
were #11, 21, 22, which lost 34, 48 and 32 % of their original traffic. These sites all had 
previous links from 23, thus making the link less likelly to be chosen. The big winners were
sites # 0, 3, 10, 17, and 20, all which saw in increase of approximatelly 33% of traffic.
